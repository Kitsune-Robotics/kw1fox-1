# Houston-SSTV

This container should do a few things:

 - Run QSSTV (lol, obvio)
 - Publish a little livestream of just the cropped sstv frame (and also maybe the waterfall display too?) (also what protocol?)
 - Save received images to a common volume (What volume?)
 - Listen to the passed audio adapter (jack?)

trying to use this as a guide, so far i think that we should go back to like, running everything as appuser? maybe privileged mode is confusing things?
