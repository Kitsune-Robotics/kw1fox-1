# Mission Controller UI

Everything here is a WIP!

The goal in here, is to package up a docker container that will serve a UI, and connect both to the database
(for long term display graphs and stuff) as well as show some live info.

It just needs to serve a simple web page, and generally doesn't have any way to actually input new commands/data (yet)
